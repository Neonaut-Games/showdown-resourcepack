[all players are blinded and frozen at random points in the map]

Welcome to the field test- or as we like to call it- Showdown.

[intro music starts playing]

You and your opponents have been randomly placed around this controlled environment.
You will be given abilities and items over time and can also find them in the world around you.
Throughout the match, this arena will slowly shrink, pushing all players towards the center.
Your goal is to survive as long as possible, withstanding all challenges and obstacles that
the simulation may force upon you. If you happen to encounter another player, kill them. Begin.

Ooh, shiny!

#	pickup-weapon-2.ogg

This one should be lots of fun.

#	pickup-weapon-3.ogg

Do you feel it, contestant, the power? The rage?

#	pickup-weapon-4.ogg

You've been granted power, so use it. Kill them.

#	pickup-weapon-5.ogg

Hmm, what does this trinket do?

#	win-message-1.ogg

Victory, victory! Don't get used to it.

#	win-message-2.ogg

You're one step closer to earning your freedom! Well, kinda. I guess 1 is closer to infinity than 0.

#	win-message-3.ogg

You show... potential. I'll notify them about you.

#	win-message-4.ogg

Good job contestant! You really outdid yourself. Well, this time.

#	lose-message-1.ogg

You died, boo hoo.

#	lose-message-2.ogg

What's another loss, right? You can't get knocked down if you were already there.

#	lose-message-3.ogg

Hey, winning isn't for everyone, and by the looks of it, it definitely isn't for you.

#	lose-message-4.ogg

Back to square one! You're making quite a home for yourself here.
